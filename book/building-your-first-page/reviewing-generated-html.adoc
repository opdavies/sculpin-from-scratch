= Reviewing index.html

If you look at the `index.html` file, you should see this:

[source,html]
----
<p>Hello, World!</p>
----

The `Hello, World!` text has been parsed as Markdown and converted to HTML.

The same would happen for any Markdown text.

If, for example, the string changed to `# Hello, World!`, the HTML would change to be a level 1 heading.

== Where we are

This is what your project should now look like:

----
.
├── composer.json
├── composer.lock
├── output_dev
│   └── index.html
├── source
│   └── index.md
└── vendor
----

You have a `source` directory for your source files and an `{sculpin_output_dir}` directory for the generated static files.

When you run `{sculpin_generate}`, any source files will be converted to HTML and placed in the output directory.

[NOTE]
====
To avoid committing the generated HTML files, add `output_*` to your `.gitignore` file.
