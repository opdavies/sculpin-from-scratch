= The first build

With Sculpin installed, run `vendor/bin/sculpin generate` to generate the website.

----
The "/home/opdavies/Code/code.oliverdavies.uk/opdavies/sculpin-from-scratch/source" directory does not exist.
----

The `source` directory contains your source files - e.g. your HTML, Twig and Markdown files.

Without it, Sculpin cannot generate a website.

To fix this, create an empty directory by running `mkdir source` and run `vendor/bin/sculpin generate` again.

You will see this message in your output, but you can ignore it:

----
Didn't find at least one of this type : posts

We will cover content types in another chapter.

////
[NOTE]
====
Simplify the command by adding `vendor/bin` to your path.

Then, you can just run `sculpin generate`.

== Where we are

This is what your project should now look like:

----
.
├── composer.json
├── composer.lock
├── source
└── vendor
----

This will build, but as you haven't added any source files, nothing will be generated.

Let's create your first page in the next chapter.
