In this book, we'll be using {link_sculpin} - a static site generator written in PHP.

Whilst you don't need to write any PHP to use it, you need to have it installed.

Run `php -v` in a Terminal to see if you have it installed and, if so, what version.

You'll also need {link_composer} - PHP's package manager - to download and install packages (including Sculpin itself).

Once we have it installed, we'll be using HTML, {link_twig} and {link_markdown} to build pages.
